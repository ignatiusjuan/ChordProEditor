(intro)                                               
G           Bm               Em     C        Em              Am              
I read the news today, oh boy, about a lucky man who made the grade
Cmaj7

G                Bm                 Em     C            F             Em
And thought the news were rather sad, well I just had to laugh 
E?

C          F           Em     Cmaj7
I saw the photograph      
G            Bm              Em     C          Em                Am          
He blew his mind out in a car, he didn't notice that the lights had
        Cmaj7
changed 
G           Bm                 Em        C                F           
A crowd of people stood and stared, they'd seen his face before
Em                          E?                         C     
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
G        Bm               Em     C            Em              Am            Cmaj7
I saw a film today, oh boy, the england army had just won the war 
G           Bm               Em     C           F           
A crowd of people turned away, but I just had to look
Em       E?         C    
Having read the book
            Bm          G         G?        E
I'd love to turn .... you .... on .... 
E                                                     D    
Wake up, fell out of bed, dragged a combed across my head
         E                   F#m7                   E             F#m7           
Found my way downstairs and dranked a cup, and looking up I noticed I w
as late
E                                                             D    
Grabbed my coat, and grabbed my hat, made the bus in seconds flat
         E                 F#m7                 E                     F#m7       
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, and somebody spoke and I went in
to a dream
C           G          D           A                C           G          D           A
Ahhhhh...                                       Ahhhhh...                       
G           Bm               Em     C              Em                   Am   
I read the news today, oh boy, four thousand holes in Blackburn Lac
        Cmaj7
anshire 
G               Bm                  Em       C            F              
And though the holes were rather small, they had to count them all
Em                                E?                         C    
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
            Bm          G         G?        E
I'd love to turn .... you .... on ....
