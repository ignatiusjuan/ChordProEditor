I see trees of green, red roses too
Gm7          F         A7     Dm       
I see them bloom for me and you
        Db         Gm7(C)        C7          F     F+5      Bmaj7
And I think to myself what a wonderful world  
C7      F    Am         Bb         Am           
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
      Gm7           F    A7            Dm            
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
        Db         Gm7(C)       C7          F     Bb         F
And I think to myself what a wonderful world    
      C7                    F                      
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
      C7              F                    
Are also on the faces of people goin' by
       Dm        C(E)           Dm(F)             C(G)             
I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' How do you do!
Dm(F)          F#dim      Gm7    F#dim      C7      
They're really sayin' I love you
     F     Am     Bb            Am         
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
Gm7                 F            A7   Dm              
They'll learn so much more than I'll ever know

And I think to myself what a wonderful world
